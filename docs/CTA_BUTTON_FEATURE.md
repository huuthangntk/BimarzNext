## Design Rationale

### Why "1 GB Completely Free"?
- **Concrete Value**: Specific data amount (1 GB) is more compelling than abstract concepts
- **Clear Benefit**: Users immediately understand what they're getting
- **Trust**: Transparency about the free tier builds credibility
- **Urgency**: "Completely Free" emphasizes the zero-cost benefit

### Why Gift Box Icon?
- **Visual Cue**: Instantly communicates "free gift" or "bonus"
- **Universal Symbol**: Gift boxes are universally recognized across cultures
- **Positive Emotion**: Evokes feelings of receiving a present
- **Balance**: Icon adds visual interest and breaks up the text

### Why Emerald/Green?
- **Safety**: Green universally represents safety and security
- **Stability**: Solid, non-glitchy appearance reinforces trust
- **Positive Action**: Green often means "go" or positive action
- **Contrast**: Stands out against the red danger theme of Page 1
- **Generosity**: Green is also associated with growth and giving

### Why Glow Animation?
- **Attention**: Draws user's eye to the most important action
- **Premium Feel**: High-quality glow effect suggests premium service
- **Breathing Effect**: Pulsing glow feels alive and inviting
- **Security**: Steady, rhythmic glow conveys stability and protection

### Why Smooth Scroll?
- **Storytelling**: Users see the full journey from danger to freedom
- **Engagement**: More engaging than a sudden jump
- **Context**: Users understand what they're getting before seeing pricing
- **Premium Experience**: Smooth animations enhance perceived quality
