# Pull-to-Refresh Fix for Page 1

## Problem
When users were on Page 1 (the topmost page) and tried to swipe down, the browser's native pull-to-refresh behavior was blocked. This was caused by global CSS rules that prevented overscroll behavior across the entire app.

## Root Cause
In `app/globals.css`:
- Line 84: `html { overscroll-behavior-y: none; }`
- Line 94: `body { overscroll-behavior-y: none; }`

These rules globally disabled pull-to-refresh to prevent unwanted behavior during page navigation, but they also blocked the desired pull-to-refresh on Page 1.

## Solution
Added dynamic `overscroll-behavior` management in `components/MainPageContent.tsx`:

### Implementation (Lines 125-141)
```typescript
// Manage overscroll-behavior based on current page
useEffect(() => {
  // Enable pull-to-refresh on Page 1, disable on other pages
  if (currentPage === 1) {
    document.documentElement.style.overscrollBehaviorY = 'auto';
    document.body.style.overscrollBehaviorY = 'auto';
  } else {
    document.documentElement.style.overscrollBehaviorY = 'none';
    document.body.style.overscrollBehaviorY = 'none';
  }

  return () => {
    // Cleanup: restore default
    document.documentElement.style.overscrollBehaviorY = 'none';
    document.body.style.overscrollBehaviorY = 'none';
  };
}, [currentPage]);
```

## How It Works

### Page 1 Behavior
1. **User is on Page 1** → `overscroll-behavior-y: auto` is set
2. **User swipes down** → Native browser pull-to-refresh is triggered
3. **Page refreshes** → Fresh content loaded

### Other Pages (2-7)
1. **User navigates to Page 2-7** → `overscroll-behavior-y: none` is set
2. **User swipes** → Custom page navigation works as expected
3. **No accidental refresh** → Smooth page transitions maintained

## Touch Event Handling
The existing touch event logic (lines 152-181) already had the correct logic:

```typescript
// Page 1: Allow pull-to-refresh ONLY when swiping down
if (currentPage === 1 && diff < 0) {
  // User is on page 1 and swiping down (trying to go previous)
  // Allow native browser pull-to-refresh
  return; // Don't preventDefault()
}
```

This ensures that when on Page 1 and swiping down (negative diff), the event is **not prevented**, allowing the browser's native pull-to-refresh to work.

## Benefits

✅ **Natural UX**: Users can refresh the page on Page 1 using familiar gesture  
✅ **No Side Effects**: Other pages maintain controlled navigation  
✅ **Clean Implementation**: Uses React's useEffect for lifecycle management  
✅ **Proper Cleanup**: Restores default state when component unmounts  
✅ **Performance**: No impact on animation or navigation performance

## Testing Checklist

### Mobile Testing
- [ ] On Page 1, swipe down → Browser pull-to-refresh appears
- [ ] On Page 1, swipe up → Navigate to Page 2 (no refresh)
- [ ] On Page 2-6, swipe down → Navigate to previous page (no refresh)
- [ ] On Page 2-6, swipe up → Navigate to next page (no refresh)
- [ ] On Page 7, swipe down at top → Navigate to Page 6 (no refresh)

### Desktop Testing
- [ ] Scroll wheel navigation works on all pages
- [ ] No unexpected page refreshes during navigation
- [ ] Smooth transitions between pages

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium): Full support
- ✅ Safari (iOS/macOS): Full support
- ✅ Firefox: Full support
- ✅ Samsung Internet: Full support

## Notes
- The CSS rules in `globals.css` remain unchanged to maintain default behavior
- Dynamic JavaScript overrides provide page-specific behavior
- This approach is more flexible than CSS-only solutions
- Works seamlessly with existing touch event handlers
