## Browser Testing Recommendations

Test in:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- iOS Safari (mobile)
- Chrome Android (mobile)

## Performance Notes

All animations use GPU-accelerated properties:
- `transform` (translate, scale, rotate)
- `opacity`
- Avoiding layout-triggering properties

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation supported
- Focus indicators on interactive elements
- Reduced motion support via media query
- Proper ARIA labels
- Semantic HTML structure

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run development server: `npm run dev`
3. Test all pages and features
4. Build for production: `npm run build`
5. Deploy to hosting platform (Vercel recommended)

## Known Considerations

- Font files loaded from shared `/public/` folder at repository root
- Logo and icon files also in shared `/public/` folder
- Each AI model folder is isolated and independent
- No cross-folder dependencies

## Manifest Compliance

This implementation follows the provided manifest (v2.0) line by line:
- All color specifications matched
- All typography scales implemented
- All spacing guidelines followed
- All animation requirements met
- All responsive requirements satisfied
- All lessons learned from previous implementations applied

**Status: Ready for Development Testing** ✅
