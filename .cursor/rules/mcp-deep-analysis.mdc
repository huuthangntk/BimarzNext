## Phase 1: Research via Exa AI

**MANDATORY: After identifying knowledge gaps with Clear Thought, use Exa to fill them.**

### Purpose of Exa
Exa provides AI-powered search capabilities:
- **web_search_exa** - Real-time web searches for latest information, best practices, tutorials
- **get_code_context_exa** - Specialized search for code documentation, API references, GitHub repos, Stack Overflow

### When to Use Exa
- Need latest information (post-knowledge cutoff)
- Looking for API/library documentation
- Finding code examples and implementations
- Researching best practices and tutorials
- Discovering new technologies or patterns

### Exa Search Strategy

**For API Documentation & Code Examples:**
Use `get_code_context_exa` - optimized for programming content

```typescript
mcp_exa_get_code_context_exa({
  query: "Specific library/framework API usage with context",
  tokensNum: 5000  // or "dynamic" for automatic optimization
})
```

**Examples:**
- "React useEffect hook lifecycle and cleanup with TypeScript"
- "Next.js 14 App Router server components data fetching patterns"
- "Framer Motion scroll animations best practices 2024"
- "PostgreSQL connection pooling with Node.js pg library"

**For Latest Practices & Trends:**
Use `web_search_exa` - broad web search

```typescript
mcp_exa_web_search_exa({
  query: "Detailed search query with context and timeframe",
  numResults: 5  // Adjust based on complexity
})
```

**Examples:**
- "TypeScript 5.3 new features and migration guide 2024"
- "React Server Components production deployment strategies"
- "OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow implementation tutorial 2024"
- "Docker multi-stage build optimization techniques"

### Research Workflow

**Step 1: Identify Research Needs (from Clear Thought Phase 0)**

**Step 2: Execute Exa Searches**

For code/API documentation:
```typescript
mcp_exa_get_code_context_exa({
  query: "Framer Motion useScroll hook API documentation and examples",
  tokensNum: 5000
})
```

For latest practices:
```typescript
mcp_exa_web_search_exa({
  query: "Framer Motion scroll animation performance optimization 2024",
  numResults: 5
})
```

**Step 3: IMMEDIATELY Process Results with Clear Thought**

**CRITICAL:** After EACH Exa search, IMMEDIATELY use Sequential Thinking:

```typescript
mcp_Clear_Thought_1_5_clear_thought({
  operation: "sequential_thinking",
  prompt: "Analyzing Exa results: What valuable information was found? What patterns emerge? What specific code examples or API details are useful? What additional searches are needed? How does this integrate with what I already know?",
  parameters: {
    thoughtNumber: 4,
    totalThoughts: 10,
    nextThoughtNeeded: true
  }
})
```

**Step 4: Iterate Research**

Continue searching and thinking until knowledge gaps are filled:
- Run more get_code_context_exa for deeper API understanding
- Run more web_search_exa for broader context
- Use Sequential Thinking after EACH search
- Build comprehensive mental model

### Research Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Use specific, detailed queries with context
- Use get_code_context_exa for programming content
- Use web_search_exa for latest trends/practices
- Process EACH result with Sequential Thinking immediately
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Note specific code patterns and examples

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use vague queries without context ("React hooks")
- Skip Sequential Thinking after searches
- Assume first result is complete
- Ignore conflicting information
- Copy code without understanding

---

## Phase 2: Synthesis via Clear Thought

**MANDATORY: After research, use Clear Thought to synthesize findings into a coherent understanding.**

### Synthesis Process

**Pre-Synthesis Sequential Thinking**
```typescript
mcp_Clear_Thought_1_5_clear_thought({
  operation: "sequential_thinking",
  prompt: "Ready to synthesize. I have findings from [X] Exa searches covering [topics]. Key insights: [list]. Need to compare approaches, identify patterns, select optimal solution.",
  parameters: {
    thoughtNumber: 8,
    totalThoughts: 15,
    nextThoughtNeeded: true
  }
})
```

**Mental Model Synthesis (For Complex Systems)**
```typescript
mcp_Clear_Thought_1_5_clear_thought({
  operation: "mental_model",
  prompt: `Synthesize findings from research:
  
  EXA FINDINGS:
  - Code documentation: [API details from get_code_context_exa]
  - Best practices: [patterns from web_search_exa]
  - Code examples: [working implementations]
  
  INTEGRATION:
  - Common patterns across sources
  - Divergent approaches and trade-offs
  - Recommended solution based on project constraints
  
  Apply first principles to determine the optimal approach.`,
  parameters: {}
})
```

**Systems Thinking Synthesis (For Component Integrations)**
```typescript
mcp_Clear_Thought_1_5_clear_thought({
  operation: "systems_thinking",
  prompt: "Analyze how [component A], [component B], and [component C] interact based on research findings. What are the dependencies? What are the feedback loops? What emergent behaviors might occur?",
  parameters: {}
})
```

**Post-Synthesis Sequential Thinking**
```typescript
mcp_Clear_Thought_1_5_clear_thought({
  operation: "sequential_thinking",
  prompt: "Synthesis complete. Clear winner: [approach]. Rationale: [reasons from research]. Implementation strategy: [specific steps]. Confidence level: [High/Medium] based on [evidence].",
  parameters: {
    thoughtNumber: 12,
    totalThoughts: 15,
    nextThoughtNeeded: true
  }
})
```

### Synthesis Should Produce:

- **Holistic understanding** from all sources
- **Pattern recognition** across documentation and examples
- **Comparison matrix** of approaches with pros/cons
- **Best approach identified** with solid rationale
- **Implementation roadmap** with specific steps
- **Code patterns to use** backed by research
- **Edge cases addressed** from multiple sources
- **Performance considerations** documented
- **Testing strategy** based on best practices
- **Complete confidence** to proceed

---

## Phase 3: Implementation Planning via Clear Thought

**MANDATORY: Use Clear Thought to validate synthesis and plan implementation before coding.**

### Validation Sequential Thinking

**Session #N - Validate Synthesis**
```typescript
mcp_Clear_Thought_1_5_clear_thought({
  operation: "sequential_thinking",
  prompt: "Validating synthesis. Does the approach make sense? Are findings consistent across sources? Have I missed anything critical? Is this approach proven and current? Any contradictions to resolve?",
  parameters: {
    thoughtNumber: 13,
    totalThoughts: 18,
    nextThoughtNeeded: true
  }
})
```

**Session #N+1 - Design Complete Solution**
```typescript
mcp_Clear_Thought_1_5_clear_thought({
  operation: "sequential_thinking",
  prompt: "Implementation plan: 1) [Step 1 with specifics], 2) [Step 2], 3) [Step 3]... Files to create/modify: [list]. Dependencies needed: [list]. Order of operations: [sequence]. Potential side effects: [concerns].",
  parameters: {
    thoughtNumber: 14,
    totalThoughts: 18,
    nextThoughtNeeded: true
  }
})
```

**Session #N+2 - Final Confidence Check**
```typescript
mcp_Clear_Thought_1_5_clear_thought({
  operation: "sequential_thinking",
  prompt: "Verification plan: How will I test this? What are success criteria? What could go wrong? What's the mitigation? Performance on mobile? Accessibility concerns? Confidence level and reasoning?",
  parameters: {
    thoughtNumber: 15,
    totalThoughts: 18,
    nextThoughtNeeded: true
  }
})
```

**Final Session - Ready to Implement**
```typescript
mcp_Clear_Thought_1_5_clear_thought({
  operation: "sequential_thinking",
  prompt: "All questions answered. Have: researched solution, proven patterns, implementation plan, testing strategy. Ready to execute with high confidence. This is optimal approach.",
  parameters: {
    thoughtNumber: 18,
    totalThoughts: 18,
    nextThoughtNeeded: false  // DONE
  }
})
```

---

## Phase 4: Implementation & GitHub Automation

**MANDATORY: After implementation, ALWAYS use GitHub MCP to commit and push changes automatically.**

### Implementation with Ongoing Clear Thought

Continue using Clear Thought during implementation:

```typescript
// When encountering issues
mcp_Clear_Thought_1_5_clear_thought({
  operation: "debugging_approach",
  prompt: "Encountered issue: [error]. Systematic diagnosis: [analysis].",
  parameters: {}
})

// When choosing between options
mcp_Clear_Thought_1_5_clear_thought({
  operation: "sequential_thinking",
  prompt: "Need to decide between [option A] and [option B]. Based on research: [comparison].",
  parameters: {
    thoughtNumber: 19,
    totalThoughts: 22,
    nextThoughtNeeded: true,
    isRevision: true,
    revisesThought: 14
  }
})
```

### GitHub Automation Workflow

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS commit and push changes to GitHub after implementation.**

**Account:** huuthangntk  
**Branch:** main (unless specified otherwise)

#### Method 1: Push Multiple Files (Recommended)

Use this when modifying multiple files at once:

```typescript
mcp_github_push_files({
  owner: "huuthangntk",
  repo: "claude",  // Current repository
  branch: "main",
  files: [
    {
      path: ".cursor/rules/mcp-deep-analysis.mdc",
      content: "[Complete file content]"
    },
    {
      path: "components/NewComponent.tsx",
      content: "[Component code]"
    }
  ],
  message: "feat: descriptive commit message explaining changes"
})
```

#### Method 2: Create or Update Single File

Use for single file operations:

```typescript
// First, get the current file SHA if updating
const fileInfo = await mcp_github_get_file_contents({
  owner: "huuthangntk",
  repo: "claude",
  path: ".cursor/rules/mcp-deep-analysis.mdc"
})

// Then update
mcp_github_create_or_update_file({
  owner: "huuthangntk",
  repo: "claude",
  path: ".cursor/rules/mcp-deep-analysis.mdc",
  content: "[Complete file content]",
  message: "feat: updated MCP deep analysis protocol",
  branch: "main",
  sha: fileInfo.sha  // Required for updates
})
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow conventional commits format:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
- `feat: add comprehensive MCP protocol with Clear Thought, Exa, and GitHub integration`
- `fix: resolve scroll animation performance issue on mobile`
- `docs: update API documentation with latest examples`
- `refactor: improve component structure for better maintainability`

### Complete GitHub Workflow Example

```typescript
// 1. Make code changes (write/search_replace)

// 2. Use Clear Thought to verify changes
mcp_Clear_Thought_1_5_clear_thought({
  operation: "sequential_thinking",
  prompt: "Verifying implementation: Changes made, tested locally, ready to commit. Summary: [what was changed and why].",
  parameters: {
    thoughtNumber: 25,
    totalThoughts: 25,
    nextThoughtNeeded: false
  }
})

// 3. Push to GitHub
mcp_github_push_files({
  owner: "huuthangntk",
  repo: "claude",
  branch: "main",
  files: [
    {
      path: ".cursor/rules/mcp-deep-analysis.mdc",
      content: newFileContent
    }
  ],
  message: "feat: rewrite MCP protocol with Clear Thought, Exa, and GitHub integration"
})

// 4. Confirm with Clear Thought
mcp_Clear_Thought_1_5_clear_thought({
  operation: "sequential_thinking",
  prompt: "GitHub push successful. Changes committed to main branch. Task complete.",
  parameters: {
    thoughtNumber: 26,
    totalThoughts: 26,
    nextThoughtNeeded: false
  }
})
```
