## How to Use These Rules

### Automatic Rules
- **deep-thinking-protocol.mdc** - Always active, ensures thorough analysis before acting
- **mcp-deep-analysis.mdc** - Always active, uses Sequential Thinking + Perplexity Search for context discovery
- **project-structure.mdc** - Always active, provides context automatically
- **bun-runtime.mdc** - Always active, ensures correct package manager usage

### File-Specific Rules  
- **coding-standards.mdc** - Automatically applies when editing `.ts` or `.tsx` files

### Manual/On-Demand Rules
To use design-system, browser-testing-qa, or automated-browser-testing rules, mention relevant keywords in your request:

**Examples**:
- "Use the design system to style this button" - Fetches design-system.mdc
- "Test the application for bugs" - Fetches browser-testing-qa.mdc  
- "Use browser automation to test localhost:3000" - Fetches automated-browser-testing.mdc
- "Take screenshots and analyze for bugs" - Fetches automated-browser-testing.mdc

## Rule Metadata

Each rule file contains frontmatter metadata that controls how it's applied:

```yaml
---
alwaysApply: true                    # Applied to every request
globs: *.ts,*.tsx                    # Applied to matching file patterns
description: "keyword description"   # Manually fetchable by description
---
```

## Testing the Application with Browser Tools

To execute the complete automated testing workflow described in **automated-browser-testing.mdc**:

1. **Ensure dev server is running**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Request automated testing**:
   Say: "Test the application on localhost:3000 using browser automation tools and provide proof it's bug-free"

3. **The AI will**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Take 50+ screenshots of all pages, themes, languages, and viewports
   - Test all interactive elements
   - Analyze console logs and network requests
   - Document any bugs found with evidence
   - Provide comprehensive test results summary
   - Generate proof of bug-free implementation

## Updating Rules

To update a rule:
1. Edit the corresponding `.mdc` file
2. Ensure frontmatter metadata is correct
3. Save and the rule updates automatically

To create a new rule:
1. Create a new `.mdc` file in this directory
2. Add proper frontmatter (see examples above)
3. Write the rule content in Markdown
4. Reference project files using: `[filename](mdc:path/to/filename)`

## The Deep Thinking Advantage

The **deep-thinking-protocol.mdc** rule is a meta-rule that enhances all other rules by ensuring:

1. **Quality over Speed**: Taking time to analyze prevents costly mistakes
2. **Proactive Problem Prevention**: Thinking ahead catches issues before they occur
3. **Consistent Excellence**: Every interaction benefits from structured analysis
4. **Learning Loop**: Continuous improvement through reflection

**The 4-Phase Process**:
```
Phase 1: Information Analysis (15s)  - What do I know? What do I need?
Phase 2: Impact Assessment (15s)     - What's affected? What are the risks?
Phase 3: Solution Design (15s)       - What's the best approach? What's the order?
Phase 4: Validation Check (10s)      - Am I ready? Have I considered everything?
```

## The MCP Deep Analysis Advantage

The **mcp-deep-analysis.mdc** rule enhances decision-making by combining internal analysis with external research:

**How It Works:**

1. **Structured Initial Thinking** (3 Sessions)
   - Understand what you're being asked
   - Identify knowledge gaps systematically
   - Plan targeted information gathering

2. **Targeted Research** (Perplexity Searches)
   - Get latest best practices and updates
   - Verify approaches with current industry standards
   - Discover solutions to similar problems

3. **Continuous Processing** (After Each Search)
   - Integrate new information immediately
   - Refine understanding progressively
   - Avoid information overload

4. **Final Synthesis**
   - Combine all findings
   - Create comprehensive solution
   - Ensure nothing is missed

**The Distributed Thinking Pattern:**
```
Think ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Synthesize ‚Üí Implement
```

**Benefits:**
‚úÖ Every response informed by latest developments
‚úÖ Solutions reflect current best practices
‚úÖ Edge cases discovered through research
‚úÖ Alternative approaches considered
‚úÖ Implementation decisions backed by data
‚úÖ Reduced risk of outdated approaches

**Integration with Deep Thinking:**
- **Deep Thinking** = Internal reasoning and analysis
- **MCP Analysis** = External context and verification
- **Combined** = Superior, well-informed solutions

## Maintenance

These rules should be updated when:
- Project structure changes significantly
- New technologies or libraries are added
- Coding standards evolve
- Design system is updated
- Testing protocols change
- Thinking process can be improved
