# Chapter 3: BLOCKED
## The Wall of Censorship

---

### The Day Everything Changed

September 2013. Osairon was nineteen years old and had just started university, studying computer engineering. He thought things were getting better. His tools were working. His knowledge was growing. He could access almost anything he wanted—YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia without filters.

Then, overnight, everything stopped working.

The government had upgraded their censorship infrastructure. New protocols. New detection methods. New walls.

Every tool Osairon had built—months of work—became useless in a single night.

He sat in front of his laptop, trying configuration after configuration, watching each one fail. Connection refused. Connection timed out. Connection reset.

BLOCKED.  
BLOCKED.  
BLOCKED.

For the first time since he'd started this fight, Osairon felt something he hadn't felt in years: **hopelessness.**

### The Anatomy of a Block

Let me explain what it's like when everything you love about the internet is suddenly, violently taken away.

**YouTube**: BLOCKED.  
The videos that taught him programming. The lectures from MIT and Stanford. The music that kept him sane during long coding sessions. Gone.

**Twitter**: BLOCKED.  
The only window into what was really happening in the world. The place where journalists spoke truth. The network that connected activists. Silenced.

**Facebook**: BLOCKED.  
His only way to stay in touch with friends who'd left Iran. His only connection to a world that existed beyond the walls. Severed.

**Telegram**: RESTRICTED.  
You could use it, but slowly. Deliberately throttled to be nearly unusable. Send a message: wait. Send a photo: never arrives. Start a voice call: drops immediately.

**Spotify**: BLOCKED.  
Because apparently music was dangerous too.

**Netflix**: UNAVAILABLE.  
Not blocked by Iran—simply didn't serve Iranian users. Another wall, corporate this time.

**Gmail**: FILTERED.  
You could access it, but certain messages never arrived. Certain emails were "lost." Certain attachments disappeared.

**Wikipedia**: CENSORED.  
Entire articles removed. Historical events rewritten. Information deliberately corrupted.

The internet that remained wasn't an internet at all. It was a walled garden, and the walls were closing in.

### The Breaking Point

Osairon tried everything he knew.

**Proxy servers?** Detected and blocked within hours.  
**VPN services?** Banned. Payment methods blocked. Websites inaccessible.  
**Tor Network?** Deeply inspected and throttled to unusability.  
**SSH tunnels?** Identified and terminated.  
**Custom protocols?** The new DPI was too sophisticated.

Every technique he'd learned, every trick he'd mastered—none of it worked anymore.

He spent three days straight trying to break through. Three days without sleep, subsisting on tea and stale bread, typing commands into terminals, watching them all fail.

On the third night, he finally stopped. His eyes were bloodshot. His hands were shaking. And for the first time in years, he cried.

Not from sadness. From rage.

### The Reality of Censorship

Here's what people in free countries don't understand about censorship:

It's not just about being unable to access entertainment. It's about being cut off from knowledge itself. It's about watching the world move forward while you're frozen in place. It's about knowing that somewhere, people are learning, creating, connecting—and you can't join them.

Osairon wanted to learn advanced cryptography. The best resources? Behind blocks.  
He wanted to study new programming languages. The best tutorials? Blocked.  
He wanted to understand quantum computing. The research papers? Inaccessible.  
He wanted to connect with other developers worldwide. The platforms? Gone.

The censorship wasn't just limiting freedom—it was limiting potential. It was killing dreams before they could form.

### The Conversations He Couldn't Have

At university, Osairon tried to discuss these problems with classmates.

"I can't access the MIT OpenCourseWare," he said to a friend. "How am I supposed to learn advanced algorithms?"

His friend shrugged. "Just use the textbooks the university provides."

"But they're outdated! The book is from 2005. Machine learning has completely changed since then."

Another shrug. "Then I guess we're behind. What can we do?"

That phrase haunted Osairon: *What can we do?*

It was the mantra of the defeated. The prayer of those who'd given up. The anthem of a generation that had learned to accept their cage.

He heard it everywhere:

"YouTube is blocked?" *What can we do?*  
"We can't access research papers?" *What can we do?*  
"Our internet is slower than most of Africa?" *What can we do?*

The answer his peers had accepted was: **Nothing. Accept it. Adapt. Survive.**

But Osairon's answer was different. His answer was: **Everything. Fight. Build. Free.**

---

### The Dark Period

For three weeks after the new censorship infrastructure went live, Osairon fell into what he later called his "dark period."

He stopped coding. He stopped trying. He would go to classes, sit in the back, stare at nothing. At night, he'd lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, wondering if this fight was worth it.

Maybe his friends were right. Maybe he should just accept it. Focus on school. Get a degree. Get a normal job. Stop fighting unwinnable fights.

His mother noticed. "You seem sad," she said one evening, bringing him tea.

"I'm fine," he lied.

"You're not fine. You haven't touched your computer in days."

He couldn't explain to her what he'd lost. How do you tell your mother that your dreams of becoming a world-class programmer were dying because the government had decided that accessing information was a crime?

### The Stranger's Message

Then, on day twenty-two of his dark period, Osairon received a message.

It came through one of his old encrypted channels—one he'd thought was dead. The sender was anonymous, but the message was clear:

*"They block YouTube because they're afraid of what you'll learn. They block Twitter because they're afraid of what you'll say. They block Telegram because they're afraid of who you'll connect with. Every block is an admission of weakness. They wouldn't build such high walls if they weren't terrified of what happens when you get outside."*

*"Don't give up. The walls are temporary. Your mind is permanent."*

*"— A Fellow Prisoner Who Escaped"*

Osairon read the message three times. Then a fourth. Then he closed his laptop, walked to the window, and looked out at Tehran's nightscape.

The city looked normal. Street lights. Car headlights. Apartment windows glowing. But he knew the truth: behind those normal facades, millions of people were trapped behind digital walls, unable to access the sum of human knowledge because a government had decided they were too dangerous to be free.

And in that moment, Osairon's dark period ended.

He returned to his laptop, opened a new terminal window, and typed: `mkdir project-freedom`

If the old methods didn't work, he'd invent new ones. If the commercial VPNs were blocked, he'd build his own. If the walls were too high, he'd learn to fly over them.

### The Cost of Blocking

As Osairon began his research, he started calculating the true cost of Iran's censorship:

**Economic Cost**: Billions of dollars lost as Iranian programmers couldn't access tools, couldn't freelance internationally, couldn't learn latest technologies.

**Educational Cost**: An entire generation falling behind the global tech curve because they couldn't access MIT lectures, Coursera courses, Khan Academy videos.

**Social Cost**: Families separated by borders, unable to video call. Friends scattered worldwide, unable to keep in touch.

**Innovation Cost**: Brilliant minds forced to either leave the country or work in technological isolation, reinventing wheels that had already been invented elsewhere.

**Freedom Cost**: Incalculable. You cannot measure what it costs to grow up believing that knowledge is dangerous and curiosity is a crime.

The blocks weren't just technological barriers. They were weapons designed to keep an entire nation intellectually imprisoned.

### The Realization

As Osairon studied the new censorship infrastructure, he began to understand something critical:

**The government was spending millions to build these walls. They were hiring the best engineers. They were deploying cutting-edge technology. They were working around the clock.**

Why?

Because they were losing.

If the internet wasn't a threat, they wouldn't need such sophisticated tools to control it. Every upgrade to their censorship infrastructure was an admission that people were breaking through. Every new block was proof that the desire for freedom was stronger than the desire to control.

They were blocking YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Telegram not because these services were actually dangerous to national security—but because they represented something the government couldn't control: **free exchange of information.**

And free exchange of information is the death of tyranny.

---

### The Pivot

Osairon realized he'd been thinking about the problem wrong.

He'd been trying to break through the blocks for himself. But that was selfish. And it was limited. Even if he succeeded, only he would be free.

What if instead, he built something for everyone? What if he created tools that were so good, so robust, so clever that the government couldn't block them without shutting down the internet entirely?

What if he made freedom scalable?

That's when Project Freedom became something bigger. It wasn't just about breaking through censorship—it was about making censorship impossible to maintain.

He started studying not just how to bypass blocks, but how to make blocks economically unsustainable. How to force governments to choose between having an internet and having control.

### The New Mission

Osairon wrote in his journal:

*"They've blocked everything I love about the internet. But they've also shown me their greatest weakness: they need the internet more than I do."*

*"Businesses need it for commerce. Banks need it for transactions. Government itself needs it for communication. If I can make their censorship so expensive, so difficult, so frustrating that it harms them more than it harms us..."*

*"Then the walls will fall. Not because they choose to take them down. But because they can't afford to keep them up."*

This was the beginning of Osairon's true genius. He stopped thinking like a hacker trying to break a system. He started thinking like an economist finding the system's breaking point.

### The First Prototype

Osairon spent the next six months building.

He combined techniques from a dozen different protocols. He studied how the Great Firewall worked in China and designed specifically to defeat it. He built in redundancy, adaptability, and most importantly—he made it look innocent.

His traffic would look like normal HTTPS. His connections would appear to be regular video streaming. His protocol would be so subtle that even advanced DPI couldn't reliably distinguish it from legitimate traffic.

And then, one night in March 2014, he tested it.

He connected to his homemade VPN server running in Germany (paid for with Bitcoin, registered anonymously). He configured his client software. He held his breath.

And clicked "Connect."

Three seconds later: YouTube loaded. Unblocked. Full speed.

He tried Twitter. Loaded.  
Facebook. Loaded.  
Wikipedia. Unfiltered.  
Everything. Everything worked.

Osairon sat back, and whispered: "They built walls. I built wings."

**End of Chapter 3**

The walls were the highest they'd ever been. But Osairon had learned to fly.

*Next: Chapter 4 - What If?*
